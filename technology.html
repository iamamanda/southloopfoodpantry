		The South Loop Community Church doesnâ€™t use a lot of technology but the technology they use are to help them keep the pantry organized and on track. They mainly use a computer to keep track of everything.</p>
		<h3>The Interwebs</h3>
		<p class="one">The pantry uses the internet to place orders for food. They go on the GCFD to order. Once they receive the confirmation they store it in a folder. This helps them keep track of all their orders. </p>
		
		<h3>Microsoft</h3>
		<p class="one">The church also uses Microsoft Word Excel. Using Excel, they take down the clients' information. Their name and current address, the number of people that live in their household, and if they receive food stamps is written in. Once the information is stored, the person working the check in, only has to check that person in before they receive food.  South Loop Community Church keeps all this information on a laptop, that is used only for the pantry. With this check in system they use, the pantry is able to see how many people they serve for each week, so they can estimate how much food to order for the next week.
