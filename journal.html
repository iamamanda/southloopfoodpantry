		<h3>Amanda's Journal</h3>
		<p class="one">
		My first impression of South Loop Community Church: It's so pretty.
		I volunteered twice this whole project and I really enjoyed this experience. The environment was light and cheerful, and the people there are really friendly. The clients were also very respectful. First time I went there, I was tasked with packing meat and making paper bags. It was simple tasks I didn't find to be that terrible at all. My second time, I was in the distribution room and was offering the clients fruits and meats. I enjoyed seeing the happy faces that walked in and joyfully taking their bag of goodies and knowing they'll have somethingt to eat for a few weeks. 
		
		<h3>Daja's Journal</h3>
		<p class="one">
		I volunteered at south loop community church, January 5th and 19th. Volunteering at the south loop community church, is a very humbling experience. Volunteering there, has taught me that people donâ€™t have the ability to get the things they need on their own, and that there are some people out there who are willing to help them. Volunteering at the south loop community church, my job has varied both time. My first volunteering experience consisted of me either handing out food to the clients, or bagging bags for the food. My second experience consisted of me bagging food, and handing out food again. volunteering at the South Loop Community church has helped me become more aware of the people around me situation and learn that there is something I can do to help the people who need help in chicago
